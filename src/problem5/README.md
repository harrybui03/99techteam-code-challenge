## Folder Structure:

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the folder structure in the code:

-   **controllers**: Contains functions that handle incoming requests and interact with services to process business logic.
-   **database**: This folder holds the database configuration and connection settings.
-   **entities**: Defines the data models (entities) for the database, such as the `Todo` entity, using TypeORM decorators.
-   **global**: Contains initialize all dependency.
-   **routers**: Contains the routes for handling HTTP requests and connecting them to the appropriate controller methods.
-   **schema**: Defines the structure of the database tables using TypeORM and SQLite.
-   **services**: Contains the business logic for handling todos, such as creating, updating, and deleting todos.
-   **views**: Holds the EJS templates for rendering the UI.
